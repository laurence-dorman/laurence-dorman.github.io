## Purpose

The purpose of the application is:
- To generate Mandelbrot sets as quickly and accurately as possible.
- To be able to navigate the Mandelbrot set easily.
- To both render the fractal instantly to screen and to output the generated images to disk for creating animations.
- The problem is that Mandelbrot sets take a long time to compute:
- My application attempts to solve this problem with multithreading and the use of a task-based parallelised system.
